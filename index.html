                <p>The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO, /ˈɪsroʊ/; Hindi: Bhārtīya Antrikṣa Anusandhān
                    Saṅgaṭhan) is the space agency of the Government of India and has its headquarters in the city of
                    Bangalore (also known as Bengaluru). Its vision is to "harness space technology for national
                    development while pursuing space science research & planetary exploration". The Indian National
                    Committee for Space Research (INCOSPAR) was established by Jawaharlal Nehru under
                    the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) in 1962, with the urging of scientist Vikram Sarabhai
                    recognising the need in space research. INCOSPAR grew and became ISRO in 1969, also under the
                    DAE. In 1972, the Government of India had set up a Space Commission and the Department of
                    Space (DOS), bringing ISRO under the DOS. The establishment of ISRO thus institutionalised space
                    research activities in India. It is managed by the DOS, which reports to the Prime Minister of
                    India.
                    <br><br>
                    ISRO built India's first satellite, Aryabhata, which was launched by the Soviet Union on 19 April
                    1975. It was named after the mathematician Aryabhata. In 1980, Rohini became the first satellite
                    to be placed in orbit by an Indian-made launch vehicle, SLV-3. ISRO subsequently developed two other
                    rockets: the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) for launching satellites into polar orbits and
                    the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV) for placing satellites into geostationary orbits.
                    These rockets have launched numerous communications satellites and Earth observation satellites.
                    Satellite navigation systems like GAGAN and IRNSS have been deployed. In January 2014, ISRO used an
                    indigenous cryogenic engine CE-7.5 in a GSLV-D5 launch of the GSAT-14.
                    <br><br>
                    ISRO sent a lunar orbiter, Chandrayaan-1, on 22 October 2008, which discovered lunar water in the
                    form of ice, and the Mars Orbiter Mission, on 5 November 2013, which entered Mars orbit on 24
                    September 2014, making India the first nation to succeed on its maiden attempt to Mars, as well as
                    the first space agency in Asia to reach Mars orbit. On 18 June 2016, ISRO launched twenty
                    satellites in a single vehicle, and on 15 February 2017, ISRO launched one hundred and four
                    satellites in a single rocket (PSLV-C37), a world record. ISRO launched its heaviest rocket,
                    Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle-Mark III (GSLV-Mk III), on 5 June 2017 and placed a
                    communications satellite GSAT-19 in orbit. With this launch, ISRO became capable of launching
                    4-tonne heavy satellites into GTO. On 22 July 2019, ISRO launched its second lunar mission
                    Chandrayaan-2 to study the lunar geology and the distribution of lunar water.
                    <br><br>
                    Future plans include development of the Unified Launch Vehicle, Small Satellite Launch Vehicle,
                    development of a reusable launch vehicle, human spaceflight, a space station, interplanetary probes,
                    and a solar spacecraft mission.</p>

        <p>Modern space research in India is traced to the 1920s, when scientist S. K. Mitra conducted a series of
            experiments leading to the sounding of the ionosphere by applying ground-based radio methods in Kolkata.[28]
            Later, Indian scientists like C.V. Raman and Meghnad Saha contributed to scientific principles applicable in
            space sciences. However, it was the period after 1945 that saw important developments being made in
            coordinated space research in India. Organised space research in India was spearheaded by two scientists:
            Vikram Sarabhai—founder of the Physical Research Laboratory at Ahmedabad—and Homi Bhabha, who established
            the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research in 1945. Engineers were drawn from the Indian Ordnance Factories
            on deputation to harness their knowledge of propellants and advanced metallurgy as the Ordnance factories
            were the only organisation specialising in these technologies at that time. Initial experiments in space
            sciences included the study of cosmic radiation, high altitude and airborne testing, deep underground
            experimentation at the Kolar mines—one of the deepest mining sites in the world—and studies of the upper
            atmosphere. Studies were carried out at research laboratories, universities, and independent locations.
            <br><br>
            In 1950, the Department of Atomic Energy was founded with Bhabha as its secretary. The department
            provided funding for space research throughout India. During this time, tests continued on aspects of
            meteorology and the Earth's magnetic field, a topic that was being studied in India since the establishment
            of the observatory at Colaba in 1823. In 1954, the Uttar Pradesh state observatory was established at the
            foothills of the Himalayas. The Rangpur Observatory was set up in 1957 at Osmania University, Hyderabad.
            Space research was further encouraged by the government of India. In 1957, the Soviet Union launched Sputnik
            1 and opened up possibilities for the rest of the world to conduct a space launch.
            <br><br>
            The Indian National Committee for Space Research (INCOSPAR) was set up in 1962.</p>

        <p>The prime objective of ISRO is to use space technology and its application to various national tasks. The
            Indian space programme was driven by the vision of Vikram Sarabhai, considered the father of the Indian
            space programme. As he said in 1969:
            <br><br>
        <p class="text-center">There are some who question the relevance of space activities in a developing nation. To
            us, there is no
            ambiguity of purpose. We do not have the fantasy of competing with the economically advanced nations in the
            exploration of the Moon or the planets or manned space-flight. But we are convinced that if we are to play a
            meaningful role nationally, and in the community of nations, we must be second to none in the application of
            advanced technologies to the real problems of man and society, which we find in our country. And we should
            note that the application of sophisticated technologies and methods of analysis to our problems is not to be
            confused with embarking on grandiose schemes, whose primary impact is for show rather than for progress
            measured in hard economic and social terms.</p>
        — Vikram Sarabhai,
        <br><br>
        Former president of India, A. P. J. Abdul Kalam, said:
        <br><br>
        <p class="text-center">Very many individuals with myopic vision questioned the relevance of space activities in
            a newly independent
            nation which was finding it difficult to feed its population. But neither Prime Minister Nehru nor Prof.
            Sarabhai had any ambiguity of purpose. Their vision was very clear: if Indians were to play a meaningful
            role in the community of nations, they must be second to none in the application of advanced technologies to
            their real-life problems. They had no intention of using it merely as a means of displaying our might.</p>
        — A. P. J. Abdul Kalam,
        India's economic progress has made its space program more visible and active as the country aims for greater
        self-reliance in space technology. In 2008, India launched as many as eleven satellites, including nine
        foreign and went on to become the first nation to launch ten satellites on one rocket. ISRO has put into
        operation two major satellite systems: the Indian National Satellites (INSAT) for communication services,
        and the Indian Remote Sensing Programme (IRS) satellites for management of natural resources.
        <br><br>
        In July 2012, Abdul Kalam said that research was being done by ISRO and DRDO for developing cost-reduction
        technologies for access to space.</p>

        payload.[65] As of December 2019, PSLV has launched 319 foreign satellites from 33 countries. Most
        notable among these was the launch of PSLV C37 on 15 February 2017, successfully deploying 104 satellites in
        sun-synchronous orbit, tripling the previous record held by Russia for the highest number of satellites sent
        to space on a single launch.
        <br><br>
        Payloads can be integrated in tandem configuration employing a Dual Launch Adapter. Smaller payloads are
        also placed on equipment deck and customized payload adapters.

        <p>The Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mark III (GSLV Mk III), also referred to as the Launch Vehicle
            Mark 3 (LVM3), is a three-stage medium-lift launch vehicle developed by the Indian Space Research
            Organisation (ISRO). Primarily designed to launch communication satellites into geostationary orbit, it
            is also identified as launch vehicle for crewed missions under the Indian Human Spaceflight Programme and
            dedicated science missions like Chandrayaan-2. The GSLV Mk III has a higher payload capacity than
            the similarly named GSLV Mk II.
            <br><br>
            After several delays and a sub-orbital test flight on 18 December 2014, ISRO successfully conducted the
            first orbital test launch of GSLV Mk III on 5 June 2017 from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Andhra Pradesh.
            <br><br>
            In June 2018, the Union Cabinet approved ₹43.38 billion (US$610 million) to build 10 GSLV Mk III rockets

            September 2002. The satellite was originally known as MetSat-1. In February 2003 it was renamed to
            Kalpana-1 by the Indian prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in memory of Kalpana Chawla – a NASA astronaut
            of Indian origin who perished in the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster.
            <br><br>
            ISRO also launched the Indo-French satellite SARAL on 25 February 2013. SARAL (or "Satellite with ARgos and
            AltiKa") is a cooperative altimetry technology mission. It is being used for monitoring the oceans' surface
            and sea levels. AltiKa measures ocean surface topography with an accuracy of 8 mm, against 2.5 cm on average
            using altimeters, and with a spatial resolution of 2 km.
            <br><br>
            In June 2014, ISRO launched French Earth Observation Satellite SPOT-7 (mass 714 kg) along with Singapore's
            first nano satellite VELOX-I, Canada's satellite CAN-X5, Germany's satellite AISAT, via the PSLV-C23 launch

            Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) region. The satellite was launched on 5 May 2017. During the
            18th SAARC summit held in Nepal in 2014, Indian prime minister Narendra Modi mooted the idea of a satellite
            serving the needs of SAARC member nations, part of his 'neighbourhood first' policy. One month after sworn
            in as the prime minister of India, in June 2014 Modi asked ISRO to develop a SAARC satellite, which can be
            dedicated as a 'gift' to the neighbors.
            <br><br>
            It is a satellite for the SAARC region with 12 Ku-band transponders (36 MHz each) and launch using the
            Indian Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle GSLV Mk-II. The total cost of launching the satellite is
            estimated to be about ₹2,350,000,000 (₹2.35 billion). The cost associated with the launch was met by the
            Government of India. The satellite enables full range of applications and services in the areas of
            telecommunication and broadcasting applications such as television (TV), direct-to-home (DTH), very small
            aperture terminals (VSATs), tele-education, telemedicine and disaster management support.</p>

        <h2 id="5.6">GAGAN satellite navigation system</h2>
        <p>The Ministry of Civil Aviation has decided to implement an indigenous Satellite-Based Regional GPS
            Augmentation System also known as Space-Based Augmentation System (SBAS) as part of the Satellite-Based
            Communications, Navigation, Surveillance and Air Traffic Management plan for civil aviation. The Indian SBAS
            system has been given an acronym GAGAN – GPS Aided GEO Augmented Navigation. A national plan for satellite
            navigation including implementation of Technology Demonstration System over the Indian air space as a proof
            of concept has been prepared jointly by Airports Authority of India and ISRO. Technology Demonstration
            System was completed during 2007 by installing eight Indian Reference Stations at eight Indian airports and
            linked to the Master Control Centre located near Bangalore.
            <br><br>
            The first GAGAN navigation payload was fabricated and it was proposed to be flown on GSAT-4 in April 2010.
            However, GSAT-4 was not placed in orbit as GSLV Mk II-D3 could not complete the mission. Two more GAGAN
            payloads were to be subsequently flown, one each on two geostationary satellites, GSAT-8 and GSAT-10.
            <br><br>
            The third GAGAN payload satellite GSAT-15 with an estimated lifespan of 12 years similar to GSAT-10 was
            successfully launched on 10 November 2015 at 21:34:07 UTC aboard an Ariane 5 rocket.</p>

        <p>IRNSS with an operational name NAVIC is an independent regional navigation satellite system developed by
            India. It is designed to provide accurate position information service to users in India as well as the
            region extending up to 1500 km from its borders, which is its primary service area. IRNSS provides two types
            of services, namely, Standard Positioning Service (SPS) and Restricted Service (RS) and provides a position
            accuracy of better than 20 m in the primary service area. It is an autonomous regional satellite
            navigation system being developed by Indian Space Research Organisation, which is under total control of
            Indian government. The requirement of such a navigation system is driven by the fact that access to global
            navigation systems like GPS is not guaranteed in hostile situations. ISRO initially planned to launch the
            constellation of satellites between 2012 and 2014 but the project got delayed by nearly two years.
            <br><br>
            On 1 July 2013, ISRO launched from Sriharikota the first Indian navigation satellite, the IRNSS-1A aboard a
            PSLV-C22. The constellation would comprise seven satellites built on the I-1K bus, each weighing around
            1,450 kilograms, with three satellites in the Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) and four in Geosynchronous
            Earth orbit(GSO).
            <br><br>
            On 4 April 2014, ISRO launched IRNSS-1B from Sriharikota, its second of seven IRNSS series. 19 minutes after
            launch, the PSLV-C24 was injected into its orbit. IRNSS-1C was launched on 16 October 2014, and IRNSS-1D on
            28 March 2015.
            <br><br>
            On 20 January 2016, IRNSS-1E was launched aboard PSLV-C31. On 10 March 2016, IRNSS-1F was launched aboard
            PSLV-C32. On 28 April 2016, IRNSS-1G was launched aboard PSLV-XL-C33; this satellite is the seventh and the
            last in the IRNSS system and completes India's own navigation system.
            <br><br>
            ISRO was in the process of developing four back-up satellites to the constellation of existing IRNSS
            satellites.
            <br><br>
            On 31 August 2017, ISRO failed in its attempt to launch its eighth regional navigation satellite (IRNSS-1H).
            The satellite got stuck in the fourth stage of the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle–PSLV-C39. A replacement
            satellite, IRNSS-1I, was successfully placed into orbit on 12 April 2018.
            <br><br>
            To boost the accuracy of NAVIC system, ISRO is likely to extend the Indian Regional Navigation Satellite
            System programme with new IRNSS series which will be entirely a new project as per chairman K Sivan. The new
            IRNSS series is not meant to extend its coverage beyond the regional boundaries extending up to 1,500
            kilometres (930 mi).</p>

        <h1 id="6">Human Spaceflight Programme</h1>

        <p>In 2009, the Indian Space Research Organisation proposed a budget of ₹124 billion (US$1.7 billion) for its
            human spaceflight programme. According to the Space Commission, which recommended the budget, an uncrewed
            flight will be launched after seven years from the final approval and a crewed mission will be launched
            after seven years of funding. If realised in the stated time-frame, India will become the fourth nation,
            after the USSR, USA and China, to successfully carry out crewed missions indigenously.
            <br><br>
            Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi announced in his Independence Day address of 15 August 2018 that India
            will send astronauts into space by 2022 on the new Gaganyaan spacecraft. After the announcement, ISRO
            chairman, Sivan, said ISRO has developed most of the technologies needed such as crew module and crew escape
            system, and that the project would cost less than ₹100 billion and would include sending at least 3 Indians
            to space, 300–400 km (190–250 mi) above in a spacecraft for at least seven days using a GSLV Mk-III launch
            vehicle. The chance of a female being a member of the first crew is "very high" according to the scientific

        <p>The Space Capsule Recovery Experiment (SCRE or more commonly SRE or SRE-1)[109] is an experimental spacecraft
            that was launched on 10 January 2007 using the PSLV C7 rocket, along with three other satellites. It
            remained in orbit for 12 days before re-entering the Earth's atmosphere and splashing down into the Bay of
            Bengal.
            <br><br>
            The SRE-1 was designed to demonstrate the capability to recover an orbiting space capsule and the technology
            for performing experiments in the microgravity conditions of an orbiting platform. It was also intended to
            test thermal protection, navigation, guidance, control, deceleration, and flotation systems, as well as
            study hypersonic aerothermodynamics, management of communication blackouts, and recovery operations. A
            follow-up project named SRE-2 was canceled mid-way after years of delay.

            sub-orbital flight. The crew module separated from the rocket at an altitude of 126 km (78 mi) and underwent
            free fall. The module heat shield experienced temperature in excess of 1,600 °C (2,910 °F). Parachutes were
            deployed at an altitude of 15 km (9.3 mi) to slow down the module which performed a splashdown in the Bay of
            Bengal. This flight was used to test orbital injection, separation and re-entry procedures and systems of
            the Crew Capsule. Also tested were the capsule separation, heat shields and aerobraking systems, deployment
            of parachute, retro-firing, splashdown, flotation systems and procedures to recover the Crew Capsule from
            the Bay of Bengal.

            On 5 July 2018, ISRO conducted a pad abort test of their launch abort system (LAS) at Satish Dhawan Space
            Centre, Sriharikota. This is the first in a series of tests to qualify the critical crew escape system
            technology for future crewed missions. The LAS is designed to quickly pull out the crew to safety in case of
            emergency.</p>

        <h2 id="6.2">Astronaut training and other facilities</h2>
        <p>The newly established Human Space Flight Centre (HSFC) will coordinate the IHSF campaign. ISRO will set up an
            astronaut training centre in Bangalore to prepare personnel for flights on board the crewed vehicle. The
            centre will use simulation facilities to train the selected astronauts in rescue and recovery operations and
            survival in zero gravity, and will undertake studies of the radiation environment of space. ISRO will build
            centrifuges to prepare astronauts for the acceleration phase of the launch. Existing launch facilities in
            Satish Dhawan Space Centre will be upgraded for the Indian Human Spaceflight campaign. Human Space Flight
            Centre and Glavcosmos signed an agreement on 1 July 2019 for the selection, support, medical examination and
            space training of Indian astronauts. An ISRO Technical Liaison Unit (ITLU) will be setup in Moscow to
            facilitate the development of some key technologies and establishment of special facilities which are
            essential to support life in space.</p>

        <h2 id="6.3">Crewed spacecraft</h2>
        <p>ISRO is working towards an orbital crewed spacecraft that can operate for seven days in a low Earth orbit.
            The spacecraft, called Gaganyaan (गगनयान), will be the basis of the Indian Human Spaceflight Programme. The
            spacecraft is being developed to carry up to three people, and a planned upgraded version will be equipped
            with a rendezvous and docking capability. In its maiden crewed mission, ISRO's largely autonomous 3-tonne
            spacecraft will orbit the Earth at 400 km (250 mi) in altitude for up to seven days with a two-person crew
            on board. The crewed mission is planned to be launched on ISRO's GSLV Mk III in 2022.</p>

        <h2 id="6.4">Space station</h2>
        <p>India plans to build a space station as a follow-up programme of the Gaganyaan mission. ISRO chairman K.
            Sivan has said that India will not join the International Space Station program and will instead build a 20
            tonne space station on its own. It is expected to be placed in a low earth orbit of a 400-kilometre (250 mi)
            altitude and be capable of harbouring three humans for 15–20 days. Rough time-frame is five to seven years
            after completion of Gaganyaan project.</p>

        <p>India's space era dawned when the first two-stage sounding rocket was launched from Thumba in 1963.
            <br><br>
            There is a national balloon launching facility at Hyderabad jointly supported by TIFR and ISRO. This
            facility has been extensively used for carrying out research in high energy (i.e., X- and gamma-ray)
            astronomy, IR astronomy, middle atmospheric trace constituents including CFCs & aerosols, ionisation,
            electric conductivity and electric fields.
            <br><br>
            The flux of secondary particles and X-ray and gamma-rays of atmospheric origin produced by the interaction
            of the cosmic rays is very low. This low background, in the presence of which one has to detect the feeble
            signal from cosmic sources is a major advantage in conducting hard X-ray observations from India. The second
            advantage is that many bright sources like Cyg X-1, Crab Nebula, Scorpius X-1 and Galactic Centre sources
            are observable from Hyderabad due to their favourable declination. With these considerations, an X-ray
            astronomy group was formed at TIFR in 1967 and development of an instrument with an orientable X-ray
            telescope for hard X-ray observations was undertaken. The first balloon flight with the new instrument was
            made on 28 April 1968 in which observations of Scorpius X-1 were successfully carried out. In a succession
            of balloon flights made with this instrument between 1968 and 1974 a number of binary X-ray sources
            including Cyg X-1 and Her X-1, and the diffuse cosmic X-ray background were studied. Many new and
            astrophysically important results were obtained from these observations.

            ISRO played a role in the discovery of three species of bacteria in the upper stratosphere at an altitude of
            between 20–40 km (12–25 mi). The bacteria, highly resistant to ultra-violet radiation, are not found
            elsewhere on Earth, leading to speculation on whether they are extraterrestrial in origin. These three
            bacteria can be considered to be extremophiles. The bacteria were named as Bacillus isronensis in
            recognition of ISRO's contribution in the balloon experiments, which led to its discovery, Bacillus
            aryabhata after India's celebrated ancient astronomer Aryabhata and Janibacter hoylei after the
            distinguished astrophysicist Fred Hoyle.</p>

        <p>Chandrayaan-1 was India's first mission to the Moon. The robotic lunar exploration mission included a lunar
            orbiter and an impactor called the Moon Impact Probe. ISRO launched the spacecraft using a modified version
            of the PSLV on 22 October 2008 from Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Sriharikota. The vehicle was inserted into
            lunar orbit on 8 November 2008. It carried high-resolution remote sensing equipment for visible, near
            infrared, and soft and hard X-ray frequencies. During its 312 days operational period (2 years planned), it
            surveyed the lunar surface to produce a complete map of its chemical characteristics and 3-dimensional
            topography. The polar regions were of special interest, as they possibly had ice deposits. The spacecraft
            carried 11 instruments: 5 Indian and 6 from foreign institutes and space agencies (including NASA, ESA,
            Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Brown University and other European and North American institutes/companies),
            which were carried free of cost. Chandrayaan-1 became the first lunar mission to discover existence of water
            on the Moon. The Chandrayaan-166 team was awarded the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics
            SPACE 2009 award, the International Lunar Exploration Working Group's International Co-operation award in

        <p>Chandrayaan-2 is second mission to the Moon, which included an orbiter, a lander and a rover. Chandrayaan-2
            was launched on a Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mark III (GSLV-MkIII) on 22 July 2019, consisted
            of a lunar orbiter, the Vikram lander, and the Pragyan lunar rover, all of which were developed in India. It
            is the first mission meant to explore the little-explored lunar south pole region. The main objective of the
            Chandrayaan-2 mission is to demonstrate ISRO's ability to soft-land on the lunar surface and operate a
            robotic rover on the surface. Some of its scientific aims are to conduct studies of lunar topography,
            mineralogy, elemental abundance, the lunar exosphere, and signatures of hydroxyl and water ice.
            <br><br>
            The Vikram lander, carrying the Pragyan rover, was scheduled to land on the near side of the Moon, in a
            south polar region at a latitude of about 70° south at approximately 1:50 am(IST) on 7 September 2019.
            However, the lander deviated from its intended trajectory starting from an altitude of 2.1 kilometres (1.3
            mi), and telemetry was lost seconds before touchdown was expected. A review board concluded that the
            crash-landing was caused by a software glitch. The lunar orbiter was efficiently positioned in an optimal
            lunar orbit, extending its expected service time from one year to seven years. There will be another attempt
            for soft landing on moon at the end of 2020 or early 2021, but without an orbiter.</p>

        <h1 id="9">About ISRO</h1>
        <hr>
        <P>Like the cogs of a giant wheel, scientists at ISRO perform various roles. According to Indeed, a global jobs
            website, those working in the field of space research can earn average annual salaries ranging from Rs 1.5
            lakh to Rs 6.12 lakh.
            <br><br>
            India decided to go to space when Indian National Committee for Space Research (INCOSPAR) was set up by the
            Government of India in 1962. With the visionary Dr Vikram Sarabhai at its helm, INCOSPAR set up the Thumba
            Equatorial Rocket Launching Station (TERLS) in Thiruvananthapuram for upper atmospheric research.
            <br><br>
            Indian Space Research Organisation, formed in 1969, superseded the erstwhile INCOSPAR. Vikram Sarabhai,
            having identified the role and importance of space technology in a Nation's development, provided ISRO the
            necessary direction to function as an agent of development. ISRO then embarked on its mission to provide the
            Nation space based services and to develop the technologies to achieve the same independently.
            <br><br>
            Throughout the years, ISRO has upheld its mission of bringing space to the service of the common man, to the
            service of the Nation. In the process, it has become one of the six largest space agencies in the world.
            ISRO maintains one of the largest fleet of communication satellites (INSAT) and remote sensing (IRS)
            satellites, that cater to the ever growing demand for fast and reliable communication and earth observation
            respectively. ISRO develops and delivers application specific satellite products and tools to the Nation:
            broadcasts, communications, weather forecasts, disaster management tools, Geographic Information Systems,
            cartography, navigation, telemedicine, dedicated distance education satellites being some of them.
            <br><br>
            To achieve complete self reliance in terms of these applications, it was essential to develop cost efficient
            and reliable launch systems, which took shape in the form of the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV). The
            famed PSLV went on to become a favoured carrier for satellites of various countries due to its reliability
            and cost efficiency, promoting unprecedented international collaboration. The Geosynchronous Satellite
            Launch Vehicle (GSLV) was developed keeping in mind the heavier and more demanding Geosynchronous
            communication satellites.
            <br><br>
            Apart from technological capability, ISRO has also contributed to science and science education in the
            country. Various dedicated research centres and autonomous institutions for remote sensing, astronomy and
            astrophysics, atmospheric sciences and space sciences in general function under the aegis of Department of
            Space. ISRO's own Lunar and interplanetary missions along with other scientific projects encourage and
            promote science education, apart from providing valuable data to the scientific community which in turn
            enriches science.
            <br><br>
            Future readiness is the key to maintaining an edge in technology and ISRO endeavours to optimise and enhance
            its technologies as the needs and ambitions of the country evolve. Thus, ISRO is moving forward with the
            development of heavy lift launchers, human spaceflight projects, reusable launch vehicles, semi-cryogenic
            engines, single and two stage to orbit (SSTO and TSTO) vehicles, development and use of composite materials
            for space applications etc.</P>
